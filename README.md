## Description

This is a simple web component that takes a creative take on a hamburger-icon navigation menu. Instead of sliding-in from the side of the page, this navigation menu _rotates-in_ from outside of the page. The visible content on the page rotates with it to make room for the navigation menu. It is quite a unique way to accomplish such an everyday task.

The JS logic is not anything complex or beyond what you would expect for a traditional pop-out mobile navigation menu. The CSS is where the magic happens and the _transform_ and _transition_ properties are responsible for the bulk of the animating behavior.
